This includes the satellite image part done in Google Earth Engine, namely optical visualization (Sentinel-2) and several radar visualizations (Sentinel-1):
different polarizations, composites, threshold and classification map for easier interpretation of non-technical users.
The mobile app is in concept stage only and there is no actual code available for that.
